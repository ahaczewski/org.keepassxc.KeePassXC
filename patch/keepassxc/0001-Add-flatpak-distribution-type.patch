Subject: [PATCH 1/5] Add flatpak distribution type

Enable support for the CMake option: KEEPASSXC_DIST_TYPE=Flatpak.

This can be used to install certain files with reverse-dns style names
as well as making other minor changes without affecting any other
distribution type.

It will also show Flatpak as the distribution type in the application
gui, so that bug reports correctly reflect this.
